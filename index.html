            If you are looking for a a different approach to solve your
            'problem' or looking for a practical hands on type of consultant
            then maybe we have a match. Working with people and getting the most
            out of their performance is something i have learnt to do over the
            last 30 years. It's people that make the difference and not the
            title they may or maynot have. Making them feel valued and
            empowering them will allow your organisation to grow. Let me assist
            you in this process and we can grow together.

            <h2>A personal Touch</h2>
            <p>
              A 1 to 1 with Wilf is a must for you. Whether it be a sporting
              coaching session you are looking for or are you feeling lost in
              where your personal road map is taking you? Then a 1 to 1 session
              can offer you the tools to do the job. Listening your wants and
              desires and guiding you to be able to achieve them is my
              specialty.

            <h2>Provide Guidance</h2>
            <p>
              We all differ as people, but my tried and treated 'people
              connector' I will ensure that we are all working towards the same
              goal. Using a simple approach, I will quickly identify where your
              organisation needs to be recharged. Change is something many of us
              have difficulty dealing with. Why? By asking the why question we
              will look at the reasons behind the why rather than the outcome.

              'problem' or looking for a practical hands-on type of consultant,
              then maybe we have a match. In English and in Dutch. Working with
              people and getting the most out of their themselves is something I
              have learnt to do over the last 30 years. It's people that make

                COVID-19 Liaison Officer Tokyo 2020. (CLO) The COVID-19 pandemic
                has hit the world beyond all recognition. What the future will
                bring us nobody knows. Sport and solidarity will certainly
                remain an important role in our life. The Tokyo 2020 Olympic
                Summer Games were postponed for 1 year. The International
                Olympic Committee made it mandatory that every Olympic member
                had to appoint a CLO who would need to coordinate.

                Yet the passion for sport is still the same. I am fortunate
                enough to be explain to millions of viewers all over the world
                what this passion is.
